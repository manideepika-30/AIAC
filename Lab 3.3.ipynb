        "This code defines the `calculate_power_bill_tiered` function, which calculates a power bill based on consumption and tiered rates.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of the key parts:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Function Definition:**\n",
        "    *   `def calculate_power_bill_tiered(consumption_kwh, tiers):` defines the function that takes `consumption_kwh` and a list of `tiers` as arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Tiered Pricing Logic:**\n",
        "    *   `tiers`: This argument is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a tier with a `limit` (the upper bound of consumption for that tier) and a `rate` (the cost per kWh within that tier). The tiers should be sorted by their limits in ascending order.\n",
        "    *   The code iterates through the `tiers` list to calculate the cost for the consumption falling within each tier.\n",
        "    *   `remaining_consumption`: Keeps track of the consumption that still needs to be billed across the tiers.\n",
        "    *   `previous_limit`: Stores the upper limit of the previous tier to calculate the consumption within the current tier's range.\n",
        "    *   `tier_consumption = min(remaining_consumption, limit - previous_limit)`: This is the core of the tiered calculation. It determines how much of the `remaining_consumption` falls within the current tier's range (`limit - previous_limit`).\n",
        "    *   `total_bill += tier_consumption * rate`: The charge for the consumption in the current tier is calculated and added to the `total_bill`.\n",
        "    *   `remaining_consumption -= tier_consumption`: The billed consumption for the current tier is subtracted from `remaining_consumption`.\n",
        "    *   `previous_limit = limit`: The current tier's limit becomes the `previous_limit` for the next iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Handling Consumption Beyond the Last Tier:**\n",
        "    *   `if remaining_consumption > 0:`: After iterating through all defined tiers, if there is still `remaining_consumption`, this block handles it.\n",
        "    *   `last_rate = tiers[-1][1]`: It assumes that any consumption beyond the last defined tier is billed at the rate of the last tier.\n",
        "    *   `total_bill += remaining_consumption * last_rate`: The remaining consumption is billed at the last tier's rate and added to the total bill.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Input Validation:**\n",
        "    *   Basic validation is included to check for negative consumption and ensure that tier information is provided.\n",
        "\n",
        "5.  **Example Usage:**\n",
        "    *   The example usage demonstrates how to call the function with different consumption values and the defined `tiers_example` to calculate the tiered power bill."
